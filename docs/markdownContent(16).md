## Authentication vs. Authorization

While often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions. we compare and contrast the two to show how they protect applications in complementary ways.

### What are authentication and authorization?

In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

Comparing these processes to a real-world example, when you go through security in an airport, you show your ID to authenticate your identity. Then, when you arrive at the gate, you present your boarding pass to the flight attendant, so they can authorize you to board your flight and allow access to the plane.
