Before we start to create APIs, Let's get to know the meaning of APIs and What is the REST APIs.

### What is an API? (Application Programming Interface)

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another. APIs sits between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.

### What is REST API (RESTful API) Representational state transfer?

**REST** is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Roy Fielding first presented it in 2000 in his famous [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

> Representational state transfer is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.
