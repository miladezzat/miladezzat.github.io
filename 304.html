    <h1><span>304</span> Not Modified</h1>
    <p>A conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a <a href="/200">200 OK</a>
      response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false.</p>
    <p>In other words, there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource because the
      request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional, already has a valid representation; the
      server is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of
      a <a href="/200">200 OK</a> response.</p>
    <p>The server generating a 304 response MUST generate any of the following header fields that would have been sent
      in a <a href="/200">200 OK</a> response to the same request: Cache-Control, Content-Location, Date, ETag, Expires,
      and Vary.</p>
    <p>Since the goal of a 304 response is to minimize information transfer when the recipient already has one or more
      cached representations, a sender SHOULD NOT generate representation metadata other than the above listed fields
      unless said metadata exists for the purpose of guiding cache updates (e.g., Last-Modified might be useful if the
      response does not have an ETag field).</p>
    <p>Requirements on a cache that receives a 304 response are defined in <a
        href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.3.4">Section 4.3.4 of RFC7234</a>. If the conditional
      request originated with an outbound client, such as a user agent with its own cache sending a conditional GET to a
      shared proxy, then the proxy SHOULD forward the 304 response to that client.</p>
    <p>A 304 response cannot contain a message-body; it is always terminated by the first empty line after the header
      fields.</p>
