    <h1><span>303</span> See Other</h1>
    <p>The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header
      field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request.</p>
    <p>A user agent can perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which
      might also be redirected, and present the eventual result as an answer to the original request. Note that the new
      URI in the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the effective request URI.</p>
    <p>This status code is applicable to any HTTP method. It is primarily used to allow the output of a POST action to
      redirect the user agent to a selected resource, since doing so provides the information corresponding to the POST
      response in a form that can be separately identified, bookmarked, and cached, independent of the original request.
    </p>
    <p>A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does not have a representation of the target
      resource that can be transferred by the server over HTTP. However, the Location field value refers to a resource
      that is descriptive of the target resource, such that making a retrieval request on that other resource might
      result in a representation that is useful to recipients without implying that it represents the original target
      resource. Note that answers to the questions of what can be represented, what representations are adequate, and
      what might be a useful description are outside the scope of HTTP.</p>
    <p>Except for responses to a HEAD request, the representation of a 303 response ought to contain a short hypertext
      note with a hyperlink to the same URI reference provided in the Location header field.</p>
